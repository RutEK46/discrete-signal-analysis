\centerline{Application with GUI for discrete signal analysis}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\indent The purpose of this project is to create advanced python tool for analyzing discrete signals using a wide spectrum of tools. Signals surround us in many aspects of life, from telecomunications to medicine and stock market investments. \\
\indent The first part of the work is about signals. There is introduction about what signals are and some basic tools for their analysis are described. \\
\indent The second part consist details about the most popular signal analysis methods. First chapter is devoted to detecting frequencies found in a signal using Fourier transform. And next chapter introduces the issue of signal detection in investment decisions and its interpretation, which is technical analysis. \\
\indent  The last part is abut the implementation of the tool. The chapter introduces the tools that are used in a project, it is Pycharm Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook. Next there are presented the libraries used in the project. The chapter also consist hardware requirements and installation description of the mentioned environment. Finally, there is presented the interface of the created tool and the user manual.\\
